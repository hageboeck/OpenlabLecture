We will explore the behaviour of $f(z)$ on a complex plane of 1024x1024 pixels, so we will have to apply our function a few hundred times to more than one million numbers, which is an excellent task for a GPU. For each point on the complex plane, we will keep applying the function until either the number blows up, or the maximum number of iterations is reached. Depending on how fast the number blows up, we will colour the pixel in the complex plane.\n",

    "## The Julia kernel\n",
    "Below we have a draft cuda program to approximate the Julia/Fatou sets. We want to create a kernel that applies $f(z)$ to each point in the complex plane for `maxIter` times or until $z$ starts to diverge. The floating-point coordinates for a pixel at index `(i, j)` have already been computed, but you have to figure out the correct pixel indices and write the loop to repeatedly apply the function $f(z)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tasks\n",
    "1. In the `main()` function, allocate memory for all pixels. The writePPM function expects an array of pixels in the form `{y0={x0 x1 x2 x3 ...}, y1={x0 x1 x2 x3 ...}, ... y_n }`, so allocate a one-dimensional array with enough memory for x*y pixels. There's already a section that checks for possible cuda errors, so allocate the memory just before. Don't forget to free the memory when you're done.\n",
    "1. Launch the draft kernel from the main function. Check for possible errors.\n",
    "1. Figure out a way to compute the pixel indices `i` and `j` from `threadIdx.x` and `blockIdx.x`. Find a kernel launch configuration that covers the entire image.\n",
    "1. Implement the computation `z = z^2 + c`.\n",
    "   - We will not use any external complex number classes for this, so square the complex number by hand.\n",
    "   - Plug the computation in the loop. Check that it runs\n",
    "     - for a maximum of `maxIter` times\n",
    "     - or until z starts to diverge (`|z| >= maxMagnitude`).\n",
    "   - Check that the iteration at which z diverged is recorded in the pixel array. If it didn't diverge (e.g. because the point is part of the Julia set), set the pixel to 0.\n",
    "   - Note: We use 256 colours to colour the resulting image. We scale `k` into the range `[1, 256]` for best contrast, but it's not strictly necessary.\n",
    "1. Check if you can generate a Julia image like in the example.\n"
